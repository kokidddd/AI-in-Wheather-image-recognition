#Final Observation and Explanation
This project successfully implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) using transfer learning to classify weather conditions accurately. The 
performance graphs shows the progression of training and validation loss and accuracy over 10 epochs. The training loss consistently decreased, 
demonstrating effective learning, while the validation loss stabilized with minimal fluctuations, indicating a balanced model without overfitting. The 
accuracy graph shows a steady improvement, with the training accuracy surpassing 90% and validation accuracy plateauing around 86%, reflecting 
robust generalization to unseen data.
